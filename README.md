# Firefox Quantum (57+) Styling
A very opinionated set of styling for firefox 57+ (quantum) to make it extra compact!
This is a work-in-progress and as of right now is built mainly for use in the "Compact" density mode.

Setting up this repository mainly for my own benefit, but others might find it useful.


## Place contents in:

**Windows**: *C:\\Users\\(user)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\(your profile).default\\chrome\\*  
**Mac**: */Users/(user)/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/(your profile).default/chrome/*

(Create the "chrome" folder if you don't have one already)

Customize the "windows-ten-os-color" and "custom-accent-color" in "/shell/_theme.css". The OS color has to be set manually unfortunately. In Windows 10 this is the color of your title bar.

With Firefox open, go into "Menu > Customize" and select the "Compact" density, the default theme & check off "Title Bar"
